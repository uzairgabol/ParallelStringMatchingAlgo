# Parallel String Matching Algorithms

This project implements four string matching algorithms in C language: Boyer-Moore, Horspool, Inverted-Array, and Rabin-Karp. Each algorithm is implemented in parallel using OpenMP and MPI, and a serial version is also provided for comparison.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Boyer-Moore**
   - Serial Implementation
   - OpenMP Parallel Implementation

2. **Horspool**
   - Serial Implementation
   - OpenMP Parallel Implementation
   - MPI Parallel Implementation

3. **Inverted-Array**
   - Serial Implementation
   - OpenMP Parallel Implementation

4. **Rabin-Karp**
   - Serial Implementation
   - OpenMP Parallel Implementation
   - MPI Parallel Implementation

## Running the Project

To execute the project, follow these steps (in linux terminal):

1. **Clone the repository:**
   -git clone https://github.com/uzairgabol/ParallelStringMatchingAlgo
2. cd ParallelStringMatchingAlgo
3. gcc -o menu menu.c
4. ./menu
5. To change the input file, replace the existing inp_file.txt with your desired input file.

## Results
The project displays the execution time for each algorithm in serial, OpenMP, and MPI modes. These results provide insights into the performance improvements achieved through parallelization.
